    <description>By default, the Genesis room spawns a Heaven Door/Light Beam that takes you to the next floor. In the Womb II/Utero II/???, this takes you to the Cathedral without an option to go to Sheol. This mod spawns a trapdoor alongside the heaven door so you can choose your destination.

On the last floor (dark room/chest/the void/corpse ii/home) as well as challenges, the Genesis room spawns a stairway that takes you back to the first room of the floor. Mod Config Menu will let you enable this behavior for all Genesis rooms as an alternative fix.

The same options are also available for I AM ERROR and Black Market rooms.

Note: The setting for the room is locked in when the room first loads.</description>
